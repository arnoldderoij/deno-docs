# Projects

Projects are a container for deployments, and can be associated with domains
and KV databases in an organization.

## Get project details

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}" method="get">
  Get meta information about a project by unique ID.
</OpenApiEndpoint>

## Update project details

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}" method="patch">
  Update meta information about a project.
</OpenApiEndpoint>

## Delete a project

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}" method="delete">
  Delete a project by unique ID.
</OpenApiEndpoint>

## Get project analytics

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}/analytics" method="get">
  Get analytics data for the specified project. The analytics are returned as 
  time series data in 15 minute intervals, with the <code>time</code> field 
  representing the start of the interval.
</OpenApiEndpoint>

## Get project deployments

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}/deployments" method="get">
  Get a paginated list of deployments belonging to the specified project. The 
  URLs for the next, previous, first, and last page are returned in the 
  <code>Link</code> header of the response if needed.
</OpenApiEndpoint>

## Create a project deployment

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/projects/{projectId}/deployments" method="post">
  <p>
    Initiate a build process for a new deployment. Note that this process is 
    asynchronous - a successful request to this endpoint API doesn't mean the 
    deployment is ready. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, you can track the progress of a build by polling either the&nbsp;
    <a href="../deployments">build logs for a deployment</a> or the&nbsp;
    <a href="../deployments#get-deployment-details">deployment details</a> API endpoints.
  </p>
</OpenApiEndpoint>
